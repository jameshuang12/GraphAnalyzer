# GraphAnalyzer Background
Welcome to our personal project. We are all Computer Science Majors at Vanderbilt University working on various projects to showcase our skills and learn new skillsets in the coding world. Graph Analyzer intakes two specific dates from a specific companyâ€™s stock shares. The program is capable of designing a line chart of two dates. In addition, the program has the ability to compare and provide investing strategies for the comsumer. The comsumer has the option to see the percentage change, stock prices, rsi value, adx value, moving average value, and the invested value net worth between the two dates. Moreover, the program can take a value specified by the consumer and export the best date to withdraw that amount through our algorithm.

# Skillset
API, Python, PyQt5, Matplotlib

# Additional Information
There are currently more features that are being added to the GUI of Graph Analyzer. 

# API Reference
The API used to get all the stock's data was provided by Polygon.

# How to Use
The stock_class.py was the first python file created to collect the company's stock shares. In addition, the StockSymbols.csv was created to help the program find the specific company's stock shares.
